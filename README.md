# Bible Verse Generator

**Bible Verse Generator** is a C++ console application that lets you explore Bible verses in various ways:

- View random verses from a text file
- Get a verse based on the current time of day (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Search for verses containing specific words
- View the last verse you read
- See a history of your searched words

The program saves the last displayed verse and searched words to separate files for easy reference.
